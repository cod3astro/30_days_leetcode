📝 Problem-Solving Approach

Understand the problem → carefully read constraints and examples.

Plan the solution → choose the right data structure/algorithm.

Write clean, readable code → add comments where needed.

Optimize → aim for efficient time and space complexity.

🎯 Goals

Build consistency in coding practice.

Improve problem-solving skills for interviews.

Create a resource others can learn from.

🤝 Contributing

This repo is primarily for my learning journey, but contributions, suggestions, or alternative solutions are welcome!

📌 Notes

All solutions are my own implementations unless otherwise noted.

This repository will grow as I continue solving more problems.
